# ESA Computer In A Room Challenge (CIARC) 3 - SPACE TRANSFORMERS TEAM

## Description
In this challenge of esa we were called to create an autonomous system that manages tasks and controls a Satellite - MELVIN - in space. More precisely, the tasks we were given were:
1. **Daily Map**: Capture and update the global map of MELVIN's world, 
2. **Zoned Objectives**: Capture specific zone images with predifined lens,
3. **Secret Objectives**: Recognise and stitch together images of uknown locations containing hidden sprites for identification,
4. **Emergency Beacon (EB)**: Detect distress signals worldwide and estimate their location.


## Installation
### Prerequisites
-Python >= 3.7

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh 
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git myfolder 

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

3. **Install dependancies:**
    ```sh
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
**Run the main program with:**

    python3 part4.py


## Configuration
Example of changes to be done in order to run in a different machine

Explain any configuration settings, environment variables, or parameters needed.
-> Might explain how each and every program is connected with the main program 
e.g. vel_calculation.py implemented in order to find the optimal trajectory 


## User Console
Here we have to write whatever is necessary for someone to run our console.....


## Useful API Commands
Put here all the necessary api calls ...

## Usefull guide
Generally tools folder includes nessecary scripts and functions that manages the safety needs of melvin, such as protect_battery and more. This were tools that built and serviced us from Part1
