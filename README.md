# ESA Computer In A Room Challenge (CIARC) 3 - SPACE TRANSFORMERS TEAM

## Description
In this challenge of esa we were called to create an autonomous system that manages tasks and controls a Satellite -MELVIN- in space. More precisely, the tasks we were given were:
1. **Daily Map**: Capture and update the global map of MELVIN's world, 
2. **Zoned Objectives**: Capture specific zone images with predifined lens,
3. **Secret Objectives**: Recognise and stitch together images of uknown locations containing hidden sprites for identification,
4. **Emergency Beacon (EB)**: Detect distress signals worldwide and estimate their location.


## Installation
### Prerequisites
-Python = 3.11.2

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh 
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git myfolder 

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

3. **Install dependancies:**
    ```sh
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
**Run the main program of Part 4 (located inside src folder) with:**

    python3 part4.py


## Configuration
In **src/zonedStitching.py:** need to adjust the folder where the images for the objectives will be saved, currently inside "./images". 

In **src/part4.py:** Folders to be created or automatically generated by the program when needed: 
- "ping_log.txt": Contains the ping messages from EBs,
- "exceptions.log": Contains the exceptions caught,
- "debug_stitched_map.png": The stitched map when saved from the RAM,
- "FAILURES.txt": Any objective that was either not submitted successfully or not done,
- "SUCCESSES.txt": The objectives that were handled successfully.

        
## User Console
Here we have to write whatever is necessary for someone to run our console.....


## Useful API Commands
Put here all the necessary api calls ...

## Usefull guide
The **src** folder typically contains our source code and all the necessary peripherals that we were running during the evaluation phase.

The **tools** folder typically contains essential scripts and functions that manage Melvin's safety requirements, such as *protect_battery* and other critical utilities. 

The **image processing** folder typically contains essential fucntions for stitching, image processing and map traversal.

The **automated responses** folder typically contains our API calls concerning submissions.

The **beacon probability analysis** folder contains a theoritical based analysis concerning beacon's position estimation probability.

The **training phase** folder contains code used during the training process.
